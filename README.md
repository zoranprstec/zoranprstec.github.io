# QuiZoki app

## A neat little quiz app.

I have used this project to demonstrate the usage of API calls to make an interactive web app. The user can choose category and difficulty of questions 
and then is faced with five questions each with four possible answers. User then clicks on aswers they think are correct and after submitting the app
shows them how many they scored correct and which answers are correct.
